Welcome to Cool Bro: Legend of the Troll Sword, a fighting game of two dimensional action! 
You play as a green circle with what looks like a crappy sword(SORD....) attached to the side.
A swarm(just 4 right now) of badly drawn zombie bitmap faces are jealous of your crisp vectorized
visage, and want to devour your innards. 
You must evade their horribly pixelated maws and slay the foul beasts.

The big red bar in the top center is how much damage you can take before vanishing from existence.
(I didn't draw "dead state" pictures, DEAL WITH IT 8)

CONTROLLz:

movement is performed by right clicking with mouse on destination OR with keyboard
 W: Up S: Down A: Left D: Right
Press Q to do a spinning attack, which can only be performed if the blue bar is full. 
Hold shift and left click a spot to instantly teleport there.
If you die, press R to restart. 
 
**Ignore this part - regular attack not implemented yet **
Left click or space bar to attack. 
The red box is where your sord is supposedly slashing. use your imagination.(not your hair)
