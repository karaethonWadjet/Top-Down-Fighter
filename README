Welcome to the Top down fighter game that I don't have a good working title for yet!
You play as a green circle with what looks like a crappy sword(SORD....) attached to the side.
A swarm(just 2 right now) of badly drawn zombie bitmap faces are jealous of your crisp vectorized
visage, and want to devour your innards. You must evade them and slay the beasts.

The big red bar in the top center is how much damage you can take before vanishing from existence.
(I didn't draw "dead state" pictures, DEAL WITH IT 8)

CONTROLLz:

movement is right click with mouse on destination OR
 W - Up S - Down A - Left D - Right
Left click to turn on your autoattack. 
The red box is where your sord is supposedly slashing. use your imagination.(not your hair)
